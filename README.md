CS-255 System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client is a fictional company looking for a cloud based application that will allow driving students to learn driving. Learning involves both online education and testing as well as scheduling driving instruction. 

What did you do particularly well?
I anticipated that the client's company could grow which would expand the roles needed. The client anticipated that students would enroll online, but also over the phone via a secretary. I saw that that role might be reassigned as the company grows, so instead of creating a role named "secretary" I named it "registrar". I also created another role to manage driving instruction called "scheduler". I think the client would have been okay with that role being assigned to "admin" but I fould that it was a task that didn't require full priviledges and would be necessary later as the company grew.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The assignment didn't require me to flesh out each use case in an activity diagram. I would expand the documentation to flesh out the activities for each use case. Also  I feel I could revise the schedule driving activity diagram. I think it isn't so clear how the create appointment part should work in practice.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs are important because if I cannot see how someone will use it, I cannot compose a system that will function appropriately. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When I'm gathering the requirements I first determine "who" needs to perform "what".
That begins the basis for getting to know what happens at a high level. 
Then I iterate over that to get specific on "how" someone does something. 
Lastly, I ensure the technology as implemented will meet industry standards of design, performance, security, redundancy, and maintainability.
